# aries-framework-go-ext
The Aries Framework Go Ext project adds [TrustBloc](https://github.com/trustbloc) specific components to [Hyperledger Aries Framework Go](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-go) like resolvers, protocols, key manager. 

Currently, the [BDD tests](test/bdd) demonstrate the use of [Sidetree](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/sidetree/blob/master/docs/protocol.md) (backed 
by customized [Hyperledger Fabric](https://github.com/trustbloc/fabric-mod)) as the Resolver component inside Hyperledger Aries Framework Go.
